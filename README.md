Implemented the code to generate the password based on user inputs(character type) as below:

-    Lowercase characters
-    Uppercase characters
-    Numeric values
-    Special characters

User must select password length between 8 and 128 and at leaset one type of character out of four to generate random password.
If user select only Lowercase characters,then password will be generated only with the combination of Lowercase characters.
If user select only Uppercase characters,then password will be generated only with the combination of Uppercase characters.
If user select only Special characters,then password will be generated only with the combination of Special characters.
If user select only Numeric values,then password will be generated only with the combination of Numeric values.
If user don't select any character type,will prompt to select at least one type of character.Based on user character type and length the password will be genarated.User can also select four types of characters for password.
If no character type selected,will prompt to try again.
